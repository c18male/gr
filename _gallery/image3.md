caption: The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. Itâ€™s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn programming
